# Expense-Management

## Overview

- Finance: Expense Management

* Nowadays, people shop so much that they become unable to regulate their expenditures.
* Many e-commerce websites, particularly in the technological era, such as Tiki, Shoppe, Lazada, and Grab (bikes, marts), make it simple for customers to make purchases online without carefully considering their choices.
* Typically, people buy things like clothing, gadgets, phones, books, coffee, milk tea, and other beverages.
* The following are some issues folks are having today:
  - How can they monitor their expenditures both physically (when they go to the store) and digitally?
  - How can they connect to their banks and various e-commerce sites to monitor their spending?
  - How do they create spending restrictions and notify consumers when they are met?
  - Challenge Statement:
    - Create a solution to address those issues;
    - don't limit yourself to the issues listed above;
    - consider additional issues people are already encountering.
* Notes:
  - Although some e-commerce companies do not offer APIs to access consumer data, for the purposes of this challenge, let's suppose that they do.
